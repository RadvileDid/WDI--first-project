##General Assembly Project 1: Simple front-end game

###Goal:
To create my very first single page web game using JavaScript to manipulate DOM.

###Technologies used:
* HTML5 + HTML5 Audio
* SCSS
* Javascript (ECMAScript 6) + jQuery
* Git
* Github
* Heroku

##Game - Keep Homer Alive
It is pretty simple, you need to keep homer alive. Homer can either  eat, work or sleep. You need to balance his life so he stays alive for 60 seconds.

##Process

###Research, Concepts and wireframes
To build this game I have researched industry for inspiration, created couple concepts and after a discussion with my managing teacher I have chosen one to wireframe it for development.
Here are final low fidelity wireframes that I come up for development:

###Development

Before I have started to crack this I have planned out games layout structure and how I will navigate user from one screen to another. These early decisions helped me to stick on track and save development time.

During development of the game I have faced these challenges:

*  Maintaining user experience when adding responsive styling.
* The three status bars that I had would exceed over the 100% width so I worked on disabling some buttons and functions when needed.
* Game has a few different timers and I worked to combine them 


Lessons learned:

*  I have learned that planing responsiveness and how elements will flow on different viewports is extremely important in order to deliver clean code on time.
* I have drastically improved my knowledge about html structure, css styling, responsiveness and most importantly DOM manipulation using JavaScript.
